        <h2 style="text-align: center;">How to Make Hot Wings</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">You'll find the full step-by-step instructions below, but here's what you can expect from this hot wings recipe:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong> With flour:</strong> Coat the chicken wings with a mixture of flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt. Refrigerate coated wings for at least an hour.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> In a saucepan on the stove, combine butter, hot sauce, pepper, and garlic. Stir until butter is melted, then remove from heat and reserve for later.</li>
            <li><strong>Fry the wings:</strong>Fry the chicken wings in a skillet filled with oil heated to 375 degrees F. Remove the wings and place them on a paper-towel lined plate to remove the excess oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Coat the wings:</strong>Drizzle the hot wings sauce over the fried wings or place the hot wings in a bowl with the sauce and mix together until combined.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Nicole's Top Hot Wing Tips</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;">"There ain't no thing like a chicken wing," according to culinary expert Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). "And there's no reason you should be making them at home." We couldn't have said it better ourselves. Here are a few of Nicole's top hot wing tips and tricks:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>The most budget-friendly way to make hot wings is to purchase whole chicken wings, then break them down into drumettes and flats yourself. Of course, you can buy them pre-cut if you're short on time or patience.</li>
                <li>You can keep the sauce simple or make it your own with additional ingredients. Throw in some extra vinegar if you like your wings tangy or some honey if you're craving something spicy-sweet, recommends Nicole.</li>
                <li>Don't try to fry too many wings at once. If you crowd the oil, Nicole says, you run the risk of bringing the temperature down.</li>
                <li>Make sure the fried wings are fully tossed — don't just drizzle the sauce over them. Nicole likes to make a double-batch of sauce so she can ensure each wing is fully coated.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">What to Serve with Hot Wings</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">Buffalo wings are delicious served with a side of <strong>ranch</strong> or <strong>blue cheese</strong> and cooling veggies (like celery or carrots).
                        <br> You can also serve hot wings as an appetizer for <strong>pizza</strong> or alongside <strong>mac and cheese</strong> (bonus points if you mix the hot wing sauce into the mac and cheese).</p>

                            <h2 style="text-align: center;">How to Store Hot Wings</h2>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">BStore hot wings in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days.
                                <br> For best results, reheat leftover hot wings in the oven or air fryer — this will ensure they stay crispy.</p>
